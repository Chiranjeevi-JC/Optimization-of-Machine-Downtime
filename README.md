# **🚀 Optimization of Machine Downtime**

![Project Logo](Images/img) <!-- Replace with your project logo if you have one -->

## **📝 Project Description**

The "Optimization of Machine Downtime" project focuses on enhancing the efficiency of manufacturing processes by minimizing machine downtime. This involves a detailed data analysis journey, starting with initial business moments analysis, handling outliers, addressing missing values, transforming data, and concluding with a final business moments analysis.

## **📊 Business Moments Analysis**

### **1️⃣ Initial Business Moments: Mean, Median, Mode**

Understanding the central tendency of your data is crucial. The first step is to calculate the mean, median, and mode.

*Figure 1: Initial business moments focusing on mean, median, and mode, giving an overview of data distribution.*

---

### **2️⃣ Variance & Standard Deviation**

Next, we delve into the spread of the data by calculating variance and standard deviation.

---

### **3️⃣ Skewness**

Skewness helps in understanding the asymmetry of the data distribution.

---

### **4️⃣ Kurtosis**

Kurtosis indicates the presence of outliers by measuring the "tailedness" of the data distribution.

## **🛠️ Outlier Treatment**

### **🔍 Step 1: Detecting Outliers**

Outliers can skew results. First, we detect them in the dataset.

*Figure 5: Detection of outliers, to identify potential data issues.*

### **🛠️ Step 2: Handling Outliers via Median Imputation**

Next, we apply median imputation to handle the detected outliers.

*Figure 6: Median imputation smooths out the data by addressing outliers.*

### **🧹 Step 3: Removing Leftover Outliers**

Finally, any remaining outliers post-imputation are removed.

*Figure 7: Final cleanup of leftover outliers ensures data integrity.*

## **🔧 Missing Value Handling**

### **🔍 Step 1: Identifying Missing Values**

Identifying missing values across the dataset is the next crucial step.

![Missing Values Detection](Images/img8) <!-- Replace with an actual image showing missing values detection -->

*Figure 8: Detection of missing values in the dataset.*

### **🔧 Step 2: Filling Missing Values via Mean Imputation**

We fill the missing values using mean imputation to complete the dataset.

![Missing Values Handling](Images/img9) <!-- Replace with an actual image showing missing values filled with mean imputation -->

*Figure 9: Mean imputation fills in the missing data, ensuring a complete dataset.*

## **📅 Data Transformation**

To support time-series analysis, we transform the 'Date' column by converting its datatype.

![Data Transformation](Images/img10) <!-- Replace with an actual image showing data transformation process -->

*Figure 10: Transformation of the 'Date' column for accurate time-series analysis.*

---

## **📊 Final Business Moments**

After cleaning and transforming the data, the final business moments are recalculated to reflect the improved dataset.

### **1️⃣ Final Business Moments: Mean, Median, Mode**

Recalculate the central tendency of the cleaned data.

### **2️⃣ Variance & Standard Deviation**

Review the spread of the cleaned data.

### **3️⃣ Skewness**

Recalculate skewness to check for asymmetry post-cleaning.

### **4️⃣ Kurtosis**

Analyze kurtosis again to ensure outlier management was successful.
